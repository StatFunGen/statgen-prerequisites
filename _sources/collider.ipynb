    "\n",
    "In this setup, we analyze how the correlation between two genetic variants (Variant 1 and Variant 2) changes when we condition on a third variable—disease status (Y)—that is influenced by both variants. The disease acts as a collider because it is a common effect of these two variants. Under normal circumstances, if two variables are independent (or weakly correlated), conditioning on their common effect can induce a spurious association between them. This phenomenon is known as collider bias or selection bias, and it's a critical concept in causal modeling that can lead to misleading conclusions if not properly accounted for."

    "In the full population of five individuals, the correlation between Variant 1 and Variant 2 is modestly negative (correlation = -0.468), suggesting only a weak linear relationship. However, after conditioning on individuals with disease (i.e., analyzing only those with disease status = 1), the correlation becomes perfectly negative (correlation = -1). This dramatic shift illustrates the collider effect: even if two variables are weakly or not associated in the general population, conditioning on a common outcome they influence can artificially induce strong correlation. This example highlights the importance of understanding the structure of causal relationships and avoiding inappropriate conditioning on colliders during statistical analyses.\n"
