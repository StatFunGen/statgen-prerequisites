    "\\text{Observed Association} = \\text{True Effect} + \\text{Collider Bias}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- **Collider Bias**: The false association created by conditioning on the collider\n",
    "- **Observed Association**: What we measure after incorrectly adjusting (often misleading!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem: Conditioning on Colliders Creates Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike confounders, colliders should **NOT** be included in regression models. Including a collider as a covariate can create spurious associations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 \\text{Collider} + \\epsilon \\quad \\text{(WRONG!)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This regression will give a **biased estimate** of $\\beta_1$ even when the true effect is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Happens: Selection Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlling for a collider creates **selection bias** by conditioning on a variable that depends on both exposure and outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collider structure**: $X \\rightarrow \\text{Collider} \\leftarrow Y$\n",
    "2. **Conditioning effect**: When you control for the collider, you're selecting specific combinations of X and Y\n",
    "3. **Induced association**: This selection creates an artificial association between X and Y\n",

    "- Survival to Study Age: Protective Alleles $\\leftarrow$ Survival $\\rightarrow$ Disease Resistance. Studying only elderly survivors can bias estimates of genetic effects on longevity.\n",
