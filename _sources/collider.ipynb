    "\n",
    "## The Problem: Conditioning on Colliders Creates Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike confounders, colliders should **NOT** be included in regression models. Including a collider as a covariate can create spurious associations:\n",
    "\n",

    "Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 \\text{Collider} + \\epsilon \\quad \\text{(WRONG!)}\n",

    "Controlling for a collider creates **selection bias** by conditioning on a variable that depends on both exposure and outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collider structure**: $X \\rightarrow \\text{Collider} \\leftarrow Y$\n",
    "2. **Conditioning effect**: When you control for the collider, you're selecting specific combinations of X and Y\n",

    "This example demonstrates collider bias, a common source of spurious associations in genetic studies. In our scenario, genetic variants affect BMI, and waist circumference also affects BMI, but there is no direct causal relationship between the genetic variants and waist circumference. BMI acts as a \"collider\" because it is influenced by both the genetic variants and waist circumference. When we incorrectly adjust for BMI in our analysis, we create a spurious association between genetic variants and waist circumference, even though no true direct relationship exists. This illustrates why careful consideration of causal relationships is essential before including variables as covariates in statistical models.\n",

The correct analysis shows no significant associations between genetic variants and waist circumference, which reflects the true underlying biology since we generated the data with no direct causal pathway between them. However, when we incorrectly adjust for BMI (the collider), we observe spurious significant associations. This occurs because BMI is causally influenced by both the genetic variants and waist circumference, so conditioning on BMI creates an artificial correlation between the variants and waist circumference. In real-world studies, researchers must carefully consider the causal structure of their variables to avoid such biased conclusions that could mislead scientific understanding and clinical decision-making."
